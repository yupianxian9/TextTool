# ToolText

## Overview
The Integrated File Converter Tool is a user - friendly desktop application developed using Python's `tkinter` library. This tool provides two main functions: text encoding conversion and Chinese simplified - traditional character conversion. It allows users to select a directory containing text - based files and perform the desired conversion operation on all eligible files within that directory.

## Features
1. **Encoding Conversion**: Supports converting text files from various encodings (such as UTF - 8, GBK, GB2312, Big5, etc.) to a specified target encoding.
2. **Simplified - Traditional Chinese Conversion**: Can convert text files between simplified and traditional Chinese characters.
3. **User - friendly Interface**: Uses `tkinter` and `ttk` to create a modern and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).
4. **Error Handling**: Displays error messages when issues occur during the conversion process, ensuring a smooth user experience.
